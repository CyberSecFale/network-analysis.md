# Network Structure and Security Analysis

I analyzed the network structure and security of a simulated environment to identify potential weaknesses. I mapped the network topology, identified open ports, and assessed firewall rules for gaps. I recommended closing unnecessary ports and tightening firewall rules to reduce the attack surface.

**Tools Used:** Wireshark for packet analysis, Nmap for port scanning  
**Outcome:** Improved network security by addressing identified vulnerabilities.
